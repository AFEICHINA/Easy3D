                <strong>GEO1016 text channel</strong>: <a href="https://discord.gg/zmaZDNkjjH" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/zmaZDNkjjH</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a public text chat, which you can use to post questions, to discuss, or for general chatting. It’s usually best to ask questions here since everyone can benefit from the answers.

                <strong>GEO1016 voice channel</strong>: <a href="https://discord.gg/KjrbK5p5qf" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/KjrbK5p5qf</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a public voice chat, which you join manually by clicking on it. If you join it, you will listen to what the others in the voice channel are saying (unless you deafen it &rarr; headphones icon) and everything you say will be also heard by the others (unless you mute it &rarr; mic icon). You’re free to use it anytime to discuss anything with the rest of your classmates (who are on the channel at that point).
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have joined the voice channel, you can also use it to share your screen (or a single window) with your classmates (&rarr; Go Live icon with display and arrow). When you do so, a red LIVE icon will appear next to your username, and people will be able to click on your user and see your stream.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        If you want to ask very detailed questions that are only relevant to your work, it’s probably better to do a separate one-to-one or small group call (with possible video and/or screen sharing). For that, let the teachers know on the text channel. When one of us is free, we will add you as a friend (or you can do that anytime!), and we can then start the call.

    <h3>Individual meetings with the teacher(s)</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to the regular course hours, it is also possible to meet the teachers individually (by appointment only). When you make an appointment, please indicate two time slots and a link to the meeting room (could be Zoom, Teams, whatever).
