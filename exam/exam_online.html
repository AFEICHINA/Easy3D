    <h2>Final exam</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>This is an open-book exam</strong>. Use of books, handouts, assignment reports, lecture slides/recordings are allowed; while the use of the internet and communicating with others is strictly prohibited. We are asking for your honesty to help us push back against invasive methods in remote education (e.g., online proctoring).
    </p>


    <p>
        <strong>Time &amp; location</strong>: 09:00 â€“ 11:30, Apr. 12 (Monday); online
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>When/How to receive the questions</strong>:
        the exam questions will appear as an individual assignment on <a href="https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/lms/dropbox/admin/folders_manage.d2l?ou=279114" target="_blank"> BrightSpace</a> at 8:50 (i.e., 10 minutes before the start time). All exam questions have been compiled into a PDF file.
    </p>

    <p>

        This is flexible, e.g.,
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            (<span style="color: blue">highly recommended</span>) write done your answer(s) to each question immediately after the question on the downloaded PDF file. Use the "Add text" tool (or similar) of your PDF editor (e.g., Adobe Acrobat).
        </li>

        <li>
            write done your answers using Word or any text editor. Please clearly state the question index for each answer. Convert the file into PDF format before you submit it.
        </li>

        <li>
            print the PDF file and write down your answers using a pen and then scan your exam papers into a PDF file.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>How to submit</strong>:
        name the file containing your answers to "<span style="color: blue">StudentID_FirstName_LastName.pdf</span>" and upload it to <a href="https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/lms/dropbox/admin/folders_manage.d2l?ou=279114" target="_blank"> BrightSpace</a> (the same as you did for the assignments). Please note that the submission system will be closed at 11:40 (i.e., 10 minutes after the exam finishes).
    </p>

    <h4>Please note</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Read the instructions on the exam papers carefully before you start answering the questions.
        </li>

        <li>
            The exam questions are confidential and breaching this confidentiality agreement can be penalized.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you have any questions during the exam, send Liangliang (<span style="color: blue">LiangliangNan#0976</span>) a private message on Discord. You can also send an email to <span style="color: blue">liangliang.nan@tudelft.nl</span>, but this may expect a short delay in response.
        If something goes seriously wrong (e.g., sudden illness or internet going down), do not worry. Just contact Liangliang as soon as you can for an alternative arrangement (most likely an oral exam through a video call).
