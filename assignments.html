    <p>
        In the assignments and lab exercises, you will experiment and implement (and optionally improve) various 3D computer vision algorithms/techniques using open source libraries.
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li>
            There are 3 mandatory assignments designed to get you started with programming 3D reconstruction and point cloud processing workflows. Each assignment will be released/accessible after the related lectures are delivered.
        </li>

        <li>
            Groups of 3 (ideally) students will work on assignments together. It is essential that every group member plays an active role, including in writing codes AND in writing the report. A division of tasks based on handing the role of report writing to one person and code writing to another is strongly discouraged!
        </li>

        <li>
            C++ source code frameworks are provided and you only need to implement the core algorithms. You will get every support to accomplish the assignments.
        </li>

        <li>
            The assignments together form a project, in which every subsequent assignment may depend on the previous ones. In case you fail in a previous assignment, the depending code and data will be provided for you to be able to continue on the project.
        </li>

        <li>
            Be creative with experiments; try different scenarios and discuss the pros and cons.
        </li>

        <li>
            Your report needs to include a brief description of how the tasks were distributed among the team members. This is used to differentiate individual grades (see <a href="./assignments/geo1016_report_example.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for an example of the report).
        </li>

        <li>
            You may submit an assignment multiple times, but it is mainly assessed based on your first submission. If you improve and resubmit your assignment based on feedback (from the teachers or peer-reviewing), you may receive a slightly higher mark, but no more than G0 + 0.5 (G0 denoting the mark of the first submission).
        </li>

        <li>
            Strict deadline: 10% deduction per day late, no more accepted after 3 days.
        </li>
    </ul>
